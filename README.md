**House oâ€™ Flavor** is a 2-player, cooperative cooking game, where two chefs work in a pizza parlor to complete orders. Chefs must gather ingredients, such as dough, cheese, tomatoes, sausages, and mushrooms, then chop and assemble them. However, tomatoes, after being chopped, must be cooked in a pan first to turn them into tomato sauce. After the pizza is assembled, bake it in the oven, place it on a plate, then deliver within the time limit. You earn coins based on how fast you deliver and how difficult the order is.
